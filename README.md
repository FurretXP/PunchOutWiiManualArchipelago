Punch-Out!! Wii Manual Archipelago

The goal is to get through all of Career mode and beat Mr. Sandman Title Defense.
There are item goals at three different parts for most fights, being doing a normal win, win with a star punch, or their special instant knockout if they have one.
That's about it.

You can go back and do fights in Exhibition mode incase you missed a goal in Career mode.
If you get a Star Punch KO or an Instant KO on a character, you can also mark off the Normal TKO/KO if it was your first time winning against them.

You also start with your Left/Right body blows at the start.
